# Patchable Devices
*VCV Rack plugin with Patchable Devices modules*

The main goal of this VCV Rack plugin is to introduce the concept of patch programmability - it means that a module, on the surface, serves very basic functionality, but can completely change its behavior when patched (either to itself or other modules).

Although the `patch programmability` term is heavily associated within Serge system synthesizers, Patchable Devices plugin takes additional inspirations from different manufacturers to extend the experience.

Each module has a dedicated page in the [manual](MANUAL.md) with thorough explanation of the module's inputs, outputs, features and patching tips. Please refer to this documentation if you have any troubles using the modules. If you discover a bug in the plugin, don't hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/nullJaX/vcvrack-patchable-devices/issues).
